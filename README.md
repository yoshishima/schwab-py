# `schwab-py`: A Charles Schwab API wrapper

[![Tests](https://github.com/yoshishima/schwab-py/actions/workflows/python.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yoshishima/schwab-py/actions/workflows/python.yml)

This is a maintained fork of [alexgolec's original `schwab-py`](https://github.com/alexgolec/schwab-py),
created after the upstream project went a year without updates. Thank you to
Alex Golec (`alexgolec`) for creating `schwab-py` and building the foundation
this fork continues to develop.

## What is `schwab-py`?

`schwab-py` is an unofficial wrapper around the Charles Schwab Trader and
Market Data APIs. It provides a thin Python interface over the HTTP and
streaming endpoints while returning the original response data for callers to
interpret.

Notable functionality includes:

- OAuth login, token storage, and token refresh
- Account details, balances, positions, transactions, and order history
- Order placement, replacement, cancellation, templates, and code generation
- Quotes, fundamentals, instruments, movers, market hours, and price history
- Option chains and option expiration chains
- Streaming quotes, charts, account activity, and order book data

## Requirements

`schwab-py` requires Python 3.12 or newer. The test matrix covers Python 3.12,
3.13, and 3.14, with current development focused on Python 3.14 compatibility.

## Improvements in this fork

The current fork is version 1.7.1. Changes since the original project include:

- More reliable OAuth login and callback server startup, with clearer errors
  when the callback server times out or another process owns its port.
- Safer token file updates, including atomic replacement, restrictive file
  permissions, and correct handling of token paths that are symlinks.
- More robust streaming message delivery and handler dispatch, including
  improved reader lifecycle handling and malformed message handling.
- More precise order and option price calculations using `Decimal`, plus
  clearer validation of numeric inputs and order builder state.
- Corrected price history and order history query defaults, with validation
  for optional boolean query parameters.
- Updated dependencies and automated tests for Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14
  on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

```console
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/yoshishima/schwab-py.git
```

This command installs the current fork from GitHub. The `schwab-py` package on
PyPI and the Read the Docs site are maintained separately from this fork and
may describe a different version.

Before using the library, create an account and application on the
[Charles Schwab developer site](https://developer.schwab.com/login). Record the
API key, app secret, and callback URL. The application must be approved by
Schwab before it can access the APIs, which can take several days.

See this repository's [getting-started guide](docs/getting-started.rst)
for detailed setup instructions.

## Quick start

The following example authenticates and requests available daily price history
for Apple:

```python
import json

from schwab import auth

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
app_secret = 'YOUR_APP_SECRET'
callback_url = 'https://127.0.0.1:8182/'
token_path = '/path/to/token.json'

client = auth.easy_client(
    api_key,
    app_secret,
    callback_url,
    token_path,
)

response = client.get_price_history_every_day('AAPL')
response.raise_for_status()
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
```

Never commit or share API secrets or token files.

## Important API behavior

### Price history

The raw `Client.get_price_history` method supports period-based queries or an
explicit start and end time. The `get_price_history_every_*` convenience
methods use an explicit date range and do not send the redundant `period`
parameter. If omitted, their start time defaults to January 1, 1971 UTC and
their end time defaults to the current time. Schwab may limit the returned
history based on candle frequency.

### Order history

The order-history endpoints have different maximum ranges. When date bounds
are omitted:

- `get_orders_for_account` requests the preceding 365 days.
- `get_orders_for_all_linked_accounts` requests the preceding 60 days.

Both methods default the end of the range to the current time. Pass explicit
date bounds when a narrower range is required.

### Boolean query parameters

Optional boolean parameters must be actual Python `bool` values. For example,
pass `indicative=True`, not `indicative='true'`. This validation also applies to
`include_underlying_quote`, `need_extended_hours_data`, and
`need_previous_close`.

## Migrating from `tda-api`

The former TD Ameritrade APIs are no longer available, so `tda-api` cannot be
used for new requests. See the
[transition guide](docs/tda-transition.rst)
for migration instructions.

## Why use `schwab-py`?

1. **Safer authentication.** The library implements Schwab's OAuth callback
   flow and manages token refresh, avoiding the need to build security-sensitive
   authentication code from scratch.
2. **Minimal API wrapping.** Methods expose Schwab's endpoints without hiding
   the underlying HTTP responses, allowing callers to handle status codes and
   response payloads directly.
3. **Order-building utilities.** Templates and builders make common equity and
   option orders easier to construct while retaining access to raw order specs.
4. **Synchronous and asynchronous clients.** Applications can choose the model
   that best fits their workload, including asynchronous streaming support.

## Limitations

- The API is not connected to thinkorswim-specific functionality, although it
  can access and trade against the same eligible Schwab accounts.
- Paper trading is not supported.
- Historical option pricing data is not available.
- API availability, permissions, limits, and response formats are controlled by
  Charles Schwab and may change independently of this library.
